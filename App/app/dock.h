/*
 * dock.h - pure, host-compilable UV-K5 "dock control mode" protocol core.
 *
 * This module implements ONLY the wire surface radio-server drives:
 *   0x0850 write-registers, 0x0851 read-registers -> 0x0951 RegisterInfo,
 *   0x0870 enter / 0x0871 exit full-control.
 * No keypress-sim, screen, scan, GPIO or modulation commands (radio-server
 * does everything through BK4819 registers).
 *
 * It is deliberately free of any hardware or firmware-tree include so it can
 * be compiled and unit-tested on the host. All hardware access (BK4819 read/
 * write, UART byte-out) is reached through a caller-supplied dock_hal_t. The
 * definition of "correct" is byte-compatibility with radio-server's
 * FirmwareFakeSerial + Uvk5Decoder (radio_server/backends/uvk5/); the host
 * harness in tests/host/ mirrors that fake's rules.
 *
 * Wire framing (identical to the classic Quansheng Dock / the fake):
 *   [0xAB 0xCD][Size:u16 LE][ obf( payload[Size] + CRC[2] ) ][0xDC 0xBA]
 *   payload = [opcode:u16 LE][param_len:u16 LE][params...], Size = 4+param_len.
 *   Inbound COMMAND frames carry a real CRC-16/XMODEM over the plaintext
 *   payload (validated; mismatch dropped). Outbound REPLY frames carry a
 *   DUMMY obf(0xFF 0xFF) in the CRC slot, never a real CRC.
 *
 * Obfuscation is always on (this V3 tree hard-defines bIsEncrypted == true,
 * and radio-server's dock transport always obfuscates); the classic dock's
 * plaintext-0x0514 encryption toggle is intentionally not implemented here
 * because no frame radio-server sends to a working dock exercises it.

/* ---- 0x0872 set-VFO ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Everything else in this protocol writes BK4819 registers, and none of it
 * survives the handoff back to the radio: 0x0870 backs the registers up and
 * 0x0871 ends in RADIO_SetupRegisters(true), which retunes the synthesiser
 * from the radio's OWN VFO (app/uart.c Dock_EnterFullControl -> radio.c
 * "BK4819_SetFrequency(gRxVfo->pRX->Frequency)"). So a host that tunes by
 * register can never hand the radio a channel and walk away.
 *
 * 0x0872 sets the firmware's VFO instead, and then lets the firmware's own
 * RADIO_ApplyOffset / RADIO_ConfigureSquelchAndOutputPower / RADIO_SetupRegisters
 * do the work. After it, the radio is genuinely on the channel — screen, split,
 * CTCSS, and the per-band PA calibration the host cannot read out of flash —
 * exactly as if a thumb had dialled it. It is deliberately NOT part of the
 * full-control loop: a one-shot command, so the firmware main loop is never
 * starved (that starvation is what makes the radio ignore its own PTT pin).
